# üîç Fake News Detection System   https://machine-learning-based-ai-fake-news-0xrm.onrender.com/

## What is this project?

This is a **Fake News Detection System** - a smart computer program that helps you figure out whether a news article or statement is real or fake. Think of it as a digital detective that can quickly analyze any piece of news and tell you if it's trustworthy or not.

## üéØ Why is this important?

In today's world, fake news spreads faster than real news. This can be dangerous because:
- People make important decisions based on false information
- Fake news can cause panic, confusion, and even harm
- It's hard to tell what's real and what's fake just by reading

Our system helps solve this problem by using artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically check news articles.

## üöÄ How does it work?

### Simple Explanation:
1. **You enter a news statement** - Just copy and paste any news article or statement you want to check
2. **The AI analyzes it** - Our smart computer program reads through the text and checks it against known facts
3. **You get results** - The system tells you whether the news is likely real or fake, along with an explanation

### Technical Details:
- Uses **DeepSeek AI** (a powerful artificial intelligence) to fact-check statements
- Supports **multiple languages** (English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada)
- Simulates different machine learning models for comparison
- Provides explanations for why something is considered fake or real

## üåê Features

### ‚úÖ What you can do:
- **Check any news statement** - Just paste the text you want to verify
- **Multi-language support** - Works in 5 different languages
- **Instant results** - Get answers in seconds
- **Clear explanations** - Understand why something is fake or real
- **Easy to use** - Simple web interface that anyone can use

### üîß Technical Features:
- **AI-powered fact-checking** using DeepSeek Chat
- **Translation support** for multiple Indian languages
- **Model comparison** showing results from different AI approaches
- **Caching system** for faster repeated checks
- **Modern web interface** with beautiful animations

## üìÅ Project Files Explained

| File | What it contains |
|------|------------------|
| `app.py` | The main program that runs the fake news detector |
| `templates/index.html` | The web page you see when using the system |
| `Fake.csv` | Database of fake news examples (23,000+ articles) |
| `True.csv` | Database of real news examples (21,000+ articles) |
| `agreement_data.json` | Performance data of different AI models |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to run this project

### Prerequisites (What you need):
- **Python 3.7 or higher** - The programming language this project uses
- **Internet connection** - To access the AI services
- **API key** - For the Claude AI service (you'll need to get this)

### Step-by-step setup:

1. **Download the project**
   ```bash
   # If you have git installed:
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd PROJECT
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install flask requests deep-translator
   ```

3. **Get an API key**
   - Go to [DeepSeek's website](https://www.deepseek.com/)
   - Sign up and get your API key
   - Replace the API key in `app.py` (line 10)

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your web browser**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Start checking news!

## üéÆ How to use the system

1. **Open the website** in your browser
2. **Paste a news statement** in the text box
3. **Select your language** from the dropdown menu
4. **Click "Predict the Statement"**
5. **Read the results** - You'll see:
   - Whether it's "Fake News" or "Not A Fake News"
   - Results from different AI models
   - An explanation of why the AI thinks this way

## üìä Understanding the results

### What the results mean:
- **"Fake News"** = The statement is likely false or misleading
- **"Not A Fake News"** = The statement appears to be reliable

### The different models:
- **Logistic Regression (LR)** - A statistical method for classification
- **Decision Tree (DT)** - Makes decisions by asking yes/no questions
- **Gradient Boosting (GBC)** - Combines multiple simple models
- **Random Forest (RFC)** - Uses many decision trees together

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Limitations:
- **Not 100% accurate** - AI can make mistakes, so use this as a tool, not the final word
- **Requires internet** - Needs connection to AI services
- **API costs** - Using the AI service may cost money
- **Language limitations** - Works best with English, other languages are translated

### Best practices:
- **Double-check important news** with multiple sources
- **Use this as a starting point** for fact-checking
- **Don't rely solely on AI** for critical decisions
- **Report bugs or issues** if you find them

## üîí Privacy and Security

- **Your input is processed** by external AI services
- **No data is permanently stored** on our servers
- **API keys should be kept secret** - don't share them publicly
- **Use responsibly** - this tool is for educational and informational purposes

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common problems and solutions:

**Problem**: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: Install missing packages with `pip install [package-name]`

**Problem**: API key error
**Solution**: Make sure you have a valid DeepSeek API key in `app.py`

**Problem**: Website won't load
**Solution**: Check if the server is running (`python app.py`) and go to `http://localhost:5000`

**Problem**: Translation not working
**Solution**: Check your internet connection - translation requires online access
